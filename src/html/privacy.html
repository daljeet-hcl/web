		<h3>4. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?</h3>
		<p><em><b>In Short:</b> We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information.</em></p>
		<h4>What are Cookies?</h4>
		<p>Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website.</p>
		<p>Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information. Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, GurbaniNow) are called "first party cookies". Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third party cookies". Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g. like advertising, interactive content and analytics). The parties that set these third party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.</p>
		<h4>Why do we use Cookies?</h4>
		<p>We use first and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Websites to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Online Properties. Third parties serve cookies through our Websites for advertising, analytics and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.</p>
		<p>The specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes they perform are described below (please note that the specific cookies served may vary depending on the specific Online Properties you visit):</p>
		<p><b><u>Essential Website Cookies</u>:</b></p>
		<p>These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our Websites and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas.</p>
		<p><b><u>Performance and Functionality Cookies</u>:</b></p>
		<p>These cookies are used to enhance the performance and functionality of our Websites but are non-essential to their use. However, without these cookies, certain functionality (like videos) may become unavailable.</p>
		<p><b><u>Analytics and Customization Cookies</u>:</b></p>
		<p>These cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our Website are being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our Websites for you.</p>
		<h3>5. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?</h3>
		<p><em><b>In Short:</b> If you choose to register or log in to our websites using a social media account, we may have access to certain information about you.</em></p>
		<p>Our Sites offer you the ability to register and login using your third party social media account details (like your Facebook or Twitter logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information about you from your social media provider. The profile Information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, e-mail address, friends list, profile picture as well as other information you choose to make public.</p>
		<p>We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy policy or that are otherwise made clear to you on the Sites. Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third party social media provider. We recommend that you review their privacy policy to understand how they collect, use and share your personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.</p>
		<h3>6. IS YOUR INFORMATION TRANSFERRED INTERNATIONALLY?</h3>
		<p><em><b>In Short:</b> We may transfer, store, and process your information in countries other than your own.</em></p>
		<p>Our servers are located in United States, Canada, United Kingdom, and Singapore. If you are accessing our Sites from outside United States, Canada, United Kingdom, and Singapore, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed by us in our facilities and by those third parties with whom we may share your personal information (see "WILL YOUR INFORMATION BE SHARED WITH ANYONE?" above), in and other countries.</p>
		<p>If you are a resident in the European Economic Area, then these countries may not have data protection or other laws as comprehensive as those in your country. We will however take all necessary measures to protect your personal information in accordance with this privacy policy and applicable law.</p>
		<h3>7. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>
		<p><em><b>In Short:</b> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy policy unless otherwise required by law.</em></p>
		<p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this policy will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.</p>
		<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
		<h3>8. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h3>
		<p><em><b>In Short:</b> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</em></p>
		<p>We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, please also remember that we cannot guarantee that the internet itself is 100% secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Sites is at your own risk. You should only access the services within a secure environment.</p>
		<h3>9. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h3>
		<p><em><b>In Short:</b> In some regions, such as the European Economic Area, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.</em></b></p>
		<p>In some regions (like the European Economic Area), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. To make such a request, please use the contact details provided below. We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>
		<p>If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Please note however that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Log into your account settings and update your user account.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from our active databases. However, some information may be retained in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our Terms of Use and/or comply with legal requirements.</p>
		<p>Cookies and similar technologies: Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Sites.</p>
		<p>Opting out of email marketing: You can unsubscribe from our marketing email list at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send or by contacting us using the details provided below.

		<h3>10. DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h3>
		<p><em><b>In Short:</b> Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights regarding access to your personal information.</em></p>

If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to us using the contact information provided below.<p>
		<p>If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with the Sites, you have the right to request removal of unwanted data that you publicly post on the Sites.
